## Why does this exist?

This is a collection of many algorithmes used in the _11th_ and _12th_ grade IT course at the **Hermann-von-Helmholtz-Gymnasium Potsdam**.

All of the code was initailly written in [Pascal](https://freepascal.org/) and is now translated to Python. We did this to migrate all of the teaching material to a newer language that is actually used in the real world.

As you might know, many of the included functions already exist in vanilla Python or in modules. But we want to explain how those basic algorithmes work at a lower level and therefore wrote them again. We tried to stay as close to the original code as we could. But we weren't able to do this every time as the two languages are very different.
